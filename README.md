# Shipping_ETL_Pipeline
Planned and developed an extract, transform, load pipeline that takes shipping data from 2018, cleans it, and than logs and reloads the data into 
csv files to be queried in PostgreSQL. 

Developed a data engineering pipeline to extract, transform, and load several data files from the AWS marketplace (Enigma AMS shipments 2018-2020) 
Cleaned the data and created a log of all operations being performed on the dataset. Also wrote queries to show meaningful aggregations of that data.
